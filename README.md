# Skeleton
This project is developed for a course named - "High Performance Computing: Molecular dynamics with C++" at University of Freiburg.
Skeleton for numerical projects with C++. This skeleton uses
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) and  automatically downloads
[Eigen3](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) and
[Googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest).
To accomplish this course successfully, I cordially thank [IMTEK Simulation Department](https://www.imtek.uni-freiburg.de/professuren/simulation/simulation) to guide through the process. Also we use [Ovito](https://www.ovito.org/about/) to visualize our atoms and use  [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plots.
